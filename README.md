Repository for projects developed in support of the series of articles on Cyber Risk Quantification on Medium.

## Project 1: Simple Risk Modelling

**Short description:** Create a simple risk model, that randomly generates a probability of an event based on given minimum and maximum probabilities from external data and a lognormal distribution of losses, based on given mean and standard deviation from external data.


## Project 2: Bayesian Risk Modelling

**Short description:** Create a probabilistic risk model using PyMC3, with a Poisson distribution representing the number of events per year, and a lognormal distribution of losses. Priors in the deterministic risk model can be updates based on new observations, and compared to the posterior.

## Project 3: FAIR Risk Modelling

**Short description:** Create a probabilistic risk model using PyMC3, based on FAIR (Factor Analsysis of Information Risk).
